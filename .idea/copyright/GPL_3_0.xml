    <option name="notice" value="                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#10;                       Version 3, 29 June 2007&#10;&#10; Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;https://fsf.org/&gt;&#10; Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#10; of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#10;&#10;                            Preamble&#10;&#10;  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for&#10;software and other kinds of works.&#10;&#10;  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed&#10;to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,&#10;the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to&#10;share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free&#10;software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the&#10;GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to&#10;any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to&#10;your programs, too.&#10;&#10;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#10;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#10;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#10;them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you&#10;want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new&#10;free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&#10;&#10;  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you&#10;these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have&#10;certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if&#10;you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&#10;&#10;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#10;gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same&#10;freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive&#10;or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they&#10;know their rights.&#10;&#10;  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:&#10;(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License&#10;giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&#10;&#10;  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains&#10;that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and&#10;authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as&#10;changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to&#10;authors of previous versions.&#10;&#10;  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run&#10;modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer&#10;can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of&#10;protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic&#10;pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to&#10;use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we&#10;have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those&#10;products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we&#10;stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions&#10;of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&#10;&#10;  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.&#10;States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of&#10;software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to&#10;avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could&#10;make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that&#10;patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&#10;&#10;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#10;modification follow.&#10;&#10;                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#10;&#10;  0. Definitions.&#10;&#10;  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&#10;&#10;  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of&#10;works, such as semiconductor masks.&#10;&#10;  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this&#10;License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and&#10;&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.&#10;&#10;  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work&#10;in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an&#10;exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the&#10;earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.&#10;&#10;  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based&#10;on the Program.&#10;&#10;  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without&#10;permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for&#10;infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a&#10;computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,&#10;distribution (with or without modification), making available to the&#10;public, and in some countries other activities as well.&#10;&#10;  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other&#10;parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through&#10;a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&#10;&#10;  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;&#10;to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible&#10;feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)&#10;tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the&#10;extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the&#10;work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If&#10;the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a&#10;menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&#10;&#10;  1. Source Code.&#10;&#10;  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#10;for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source&#10;form of a work.&#10;&#10;  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official&#10;standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of&#10;interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that&#10;is widely used among developers working in that language.&#10;&#10;  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other&#10;than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of&#10;packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major&#10;Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that&#10;Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an&#10;implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A&#10;&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component&#10;(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system&#10;(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to&#10;produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&#10;&#10;  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all&#10;the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable&#10;work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to&#10;control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's&#10;System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free&#10;programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but&#10;which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source&#10;includes interface definition files associated with source files for&#10;the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically&#10;linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,&#10;such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those&#10;subprograms and other parts of the work.&#10;&#10;  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users&#10;can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding&#10;Source.&#10;&#10;  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that&#10;same work.&#10;&#10;  2. Basic Permissions.&#10;&#10;  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of&#10;copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated&#10;conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited&#10;permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a&#10;covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its&#10;content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your&#10;rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.&#10;&#10;  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not&#10;convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains&#10;in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose&#10;of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you&#10;with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with&#10;the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do&#10;not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works&#10;for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction&#10;and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of&#10;your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.&#10;&#10;  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under&#10;the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10&#10;makes it unnecessary.&#10;&#10;  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&#10;&#10;  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological&#10;measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article&#10;11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or&#10;similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such&#10;measures.&#10;&#10;  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid&#10;circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention&#10;is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to&#10;the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or&#10;modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's&#10;users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of&#10;technological measures.&#10;&#10;  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&#10;&#10;  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you&#10;receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#10;appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;&#10;keep intact all notices stating that this License and any&#10;non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;&#10;keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all&#10;recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&#10;&#10;  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,&#10;and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&#10;&#10;  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&#10;&#10;  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to&#10;produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the&#10;terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#10;&#10;    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified&#10;    it, and giving a relevant date.&#10;&#10;    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is&#10;    released under this License and any conditions added under section&#10;    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to&#10;    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.&#10;&#10;    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this&#10;    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This&#10;    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7&#10;    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,&#10;    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no&#10;    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not&#10;    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&#10;&#10;    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display&#10;    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive&#10;    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your&#10;    work need not make them do so.&#10;&#10;  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent&#10;works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,&#10;and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,&#10;in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an&#10;&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not&#10;used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users&#10;beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work&#10;in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other&#10;parts of the aggregate.&#10;&#10;  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&#10;&#10;  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms&#10;of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the&#10;machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,&#10;in one of these ways:&#10;&#10;    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#10;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the&#10;    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium&#10;    customarily used for software interchange.&#10;&#10;    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#10;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a&#10;    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as&#10;    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product&#10;    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a&#10;    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the&#10;    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical&#10;    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no&#10;    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this&#10;    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the&#10;    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&#10;&#10;    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the&#10;    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This&#10;    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and&#10;    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord&#10;    with subsection 6b.&#10;&#10;    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated&#10;    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the&#10;    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no&#10;    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the&#10;    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to&#10;    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source&#10;    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)&#10;    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain&#10;    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the&#10;    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the&#10;    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is&#10;    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&#10;&#10;    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided&#10;    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding&#10;    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no&#10;    charge under subsection 6d.&#10;&#10;  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded&#10;from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be&#10;included in conveying the object code work.&#10;&#10;  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any&#10;tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,&#10;or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation&#10;into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,&#10;doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular&#10;product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a&#10;typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status&#10;of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user&#10;actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product&#10;is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial&#10;commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent&#10;the only significant mode of use of the product.&#10;&#10;  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,&#10;procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install&#10;and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from&#10;a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must&#10;suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object&#10;code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because&#10;modification has been made.&#10;&#10;  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or&#10;specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as&#10;part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the&#10;User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a&#10;fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the&#10;Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied&#10;by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply&#10;if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install&#10;modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has&#10;been installed in ROM).&#10;&#10;  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a&#10;requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates&#10;for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for&#10;the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a&#10;network may be denied when the modification itself materially and&#10;adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and&#10;protocols for communication across the network.&#10;&#10;  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,&#10;in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly&#10;documented (and with an implementation available to the public in&#10;source code form), and must require no special password or key for&#10;unpacking, reading or copying.&#10;&#10;  7. Additional Terms.&#10;&#10;  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this&#10;License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&#10;Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall&#10;be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent&#10;that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions&#10;apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately&#10;under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by&#10;this License without regard to the additional permissions.&#10;&#10;  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option&#10;remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of&#10;it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own&#10;removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place&#10;additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,&#10;for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&#10;&#10;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you&#10;add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of&#10;that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:&#10;&#10;    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the&#10;    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&#10;&#10;    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or&#10;    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal&#10;    Notices displayed by works containing it; or&#10;&#10;    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or&#10;    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in&#10;    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&#10;&#10;    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or&#10;    authors of the material; or&#10;&#10;    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some&#10;    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&#10;&#10;    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that&#10;    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of&#10;    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for&#10;    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on&#10;    those licensors and authors.&#10;&#10;  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further&#10;restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you&#10;received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is&#10;governed by this License along with a term that is a further&#10;restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains&#10;a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this&#10;License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms&#10;of that license document, provided that the further restriction does&#10;not survive such relicensing or conveying.&#10;&#10;  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you&#10;must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the&#10;additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating&#10;where to find the applicable terms.&#10;&#10;  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the&#10;form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;&#10;the above requirements apply either way.&#10;&#10;  8. Termination.&#10;&#10;  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly&#10;provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or&#10;modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under&#10;this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third&#10;paragraph of section 11).&#10;&#10;  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your&#10;license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)&#10;provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and&#10;finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright&#10;holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means&#10;prior to 60 days after the cessation.&#10;&#10;  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is&#10;reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the&#10;violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have&#10;received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that&#10;copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after&#10;your receipt of the notice.&#10;&#10;  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the&#10;licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under&#10;this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently&#10;reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same&#10;material under section 10.&#10;&#10;  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&#10;&#10;  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or&#10;run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work&#10;occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission&#10;to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,&#10;nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or&#10;modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do&#10;not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a&#10;covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.&#10;&#10;  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&#10;&#10;  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically&#10;receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and&#10;propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible&#10;for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#10;&#10;  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an&#10;organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an&#10;organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered&#10;work results from an entity transaction, each party to that&#10;transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever&#10;licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could&#10;give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the&#10;Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if&#10;the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.&#10;&#10;  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the&#10;rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may&#10;not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of&#10;rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation&#10;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that&#10;any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for&#10;sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.&#10;&#10;  11. Patents.&#10;&#10;  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this&#10;License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The&#10;work thus licensed is called the contributor's &quot;contributor version&quot;.&#10;&#10;  A contributor's &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims&#10;owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or&#10;hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted&#10;by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,&#10;but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a&#10;consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For&#10;purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant&#10;patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of&#10;this License.&#10;&#10;  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#10;patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to&#10;make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and&#10;propagate the contents of its contributor version.&#10;&#10;  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express&#10;agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent&#10;(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to&#10;sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a&#10;party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a&#10;patent against the party.&#10;&#10;  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,&#10;and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone&#10;to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a&#10;publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,&#10;then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so&#10;available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the&#10;patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner&#10;consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent&#10;license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have&#10;actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the&#10;covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work&#10;in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that&#10;country that you have reason to believe are valid.&#10;&#10;  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or&#10;arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a&#10;covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties&#10;receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify&#10;or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license&#10;you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered&#10;work and works based on it.&#10;&#10;  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within&#10;the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is&#10;conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are&#10;specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered&#10;work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is&#10;in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment&#10;to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying&#10;the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the&#10;parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory&#10;patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work&#10;conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily&#10;for and in connection with specific products or compilations that&#10;contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,&#10;or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&#10;&#10;  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting&#10;any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may&#10;otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.&#10;&#10;  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.&#10;&#10;  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#10;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#10;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a&#10;covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#10;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may&#10;not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you&#10;to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey&#10;the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this&#10;License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&#10;&#10;  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&#10;&#10;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have&#10;permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed&#10;under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single&#10;combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this&#10;License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,&#10;but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,&#10;section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the&#10;combination as such.&#10;&#10;  14. Revised Versions of this License.&#10;&#10;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of&#10;the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#10;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#10;address new problems or concerns.&#10;&#10;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#10;Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General&#10;Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the&#10;option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered&#10;version or of any later version published by the Free Software&#10;Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the&#10;GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published&#10;by the Free Software Foundation.&#10;&#10;  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future&#10;versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's&#10;public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you&#10;to choose that version for the Program.&#10;&#10;  Later license versions may give you additional or different&#10;permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any&#10;author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a&#10;later version.&#10;&#10;  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.&#10;&#10;  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY&#10;APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#10;HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY&#10;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,&#10;THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#10;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM&#10;IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF&#10;ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#10;&#10;  16. Limitation of Liability.&#10;&#10;  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#10;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS&#10;THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&#10;GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE&#10;USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF&#10;DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD&#10;PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),&#10;EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF&#10;SUCH DAMAGES.&#10;&#10;  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.&#10;&#10;  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided&#10;above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,&#10;reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates&#10;an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the&#10;Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a&#10;copy of the Program in return for a fee.&#10;&#10;                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#10;&#10;            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&#10;&#10;  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest&#10;possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it&#10;free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.&#10;&#10;  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest&#10;to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#10;state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least&#10;the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#10;&#10;    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;&#10;    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#10;&#10;    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify&#10;    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by&#10;    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or&#10;    (at your option) any later version.&#10;&#10;    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#10;    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#10;    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the&#10;    GNU General Public License for more details.&#10;&#10;    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License&#10;    along with this program.  If not, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.&#10;&#10;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.&#10;&#10;  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short&#10;notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:&#10;&#10;    &lt;program&gt;  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#10;    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.&#10;    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it&#10;    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.&#10;&#10;The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate&#10;parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands&#10;might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an &quot;about box&quot;.&#10;&#10;  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,&#10;if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if necessary.&#10;For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see&#10;&lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.&#10;&#10;  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program&#10;into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you&#10;may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with&#10;the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General&#10;Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read&#10;&lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html&gt;.&#10;" />
