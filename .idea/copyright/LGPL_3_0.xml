Additional Definitions.&#10;&#10;  As used herein, &quot;this License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser&#10;General Public License, and the &quot;GNU GPL&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU&#10;General Public License.&#10;&#10;  &quot;The Library&quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License,&#10;other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.&#10;&#10;  An &quot;Application&quot; is any work that makes use of an interface provided&#10;by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.&#10;Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode&#10;of using an interface provided by the Library.&#10;&#10;  A &quot;Combined Work&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an&#10;Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library&#10;with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &quot;Linked&#10;Version&quot;.&#10;&#10;  The &quot;Minimal Corresponding Source&quot; for a Combined Work means the&#10;Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code&#10;for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are&#10;based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.&#10;&#10;  The &quot;Corresponding Application Code&quot; for a Combined Work means the&#10;object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data&#10;and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the&#10;Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.&#10;&#10;  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.&#10;&#10;  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License&#10;without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.&#10;&#10;  2. Conveying Modified Versions.&#10;&#10;  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a&#10;facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application&#10;that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the&#10;facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified&#10;version:&#10;&#10;   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to&#10;   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the&#10;   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs&#10;   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or&#10;&#10;   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of&#10;   this License applicable to that copy.&#10;&#10;  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.&#10;&#10;  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from&#10;a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object&#10;code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated&#10;material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure&#10;layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates&#10;(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:&#10;&#10;   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the&#10;   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are&#10;   covered by this License.&#10;&#10;   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license&#10;   document.&#10;&#10;  4. Combined Works.&#10;&#10;  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,&#10;taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the&#10;portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse&#10;engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of&#10;the following:&#10;&#10;   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that&#10;   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are&#10;   covered by this License.&#10;&#10;   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license&#10;   document.&#10;&#10;   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during&#10;   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among&#10;   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the&#10;   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.&#10;&#10;   d) Do one of the following:&#10;&#10;       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this&#10;       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form&#10;       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to&#10;       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of&#10;       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the&#10;       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying&#10;       Corresponding Source.&#10;&#10;       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#10;       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time&#10;       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer&#10;       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version&#10;       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked&#10;       Version.&#10;&#10;   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise&#10;   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the&#10;   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is&#10;   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the&#10;   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the&#10;   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If&#10;   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany&#10;   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application&#10;   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation&#10;   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL&#10;   for conveying Corresponding Source.)&#10;&#10;  5. Combined Libraries.&#10;&#10;  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the&#10;Library side by side in a single library together with other library&#10;facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this&#10;License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your&#10;choice, if you do both of the following:&#10;&#10;   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based&#10;   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,&#10;   conveyed under the terms of this License.&#10;&#10;   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it&#10;   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the&#10;   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#10;&#10;  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.&#10;&#10;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions&#10;of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new&#10;versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may&#10;differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#10;&#10;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the&#10;Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version&#10;of the GNU Lesser General Public License &quot;or any later version&quot;&#10;applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and&#10;conditions either of that published version or of any later version&#10;published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you&#10;received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser&#10;General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser&#10;General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.&#10;&#10;  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide&#10;whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall&#10;apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is&#10;permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the&#10;Library.&#10;" />
